# Senate Appropriations Committee Technical Take-Home Assessment

TORQ 2020-D-X052 Technical Assessment

**Welcome to the Senate Appropriations Committee Technical Take-Home Assessment.** This assessment consists of three questions designed to evaluate your ability to learn quickly, code solutions, and think through problems that don't have perfect answers.

**Guidelines.** This is to be completed by the Principal Engineer and Senior Engineer Candidates. The technical assessment is due 5:00 PM ET on Tuesday, November 12.  We understand that some parts may be challenging. It is OK if you do not complete all sections within the time allotted.  We recommend reviewing all three questions before starting, and there is no requirement to complete the assessmentâ€™s questions in order.  Feel free to use the internet for research, but do not search (or ask tools like ChatGPT) for specific solutions. We trust you to follow this rule on the honor code ðŸ˜Š 

**Submitting Your Responses.**  You have two options for completing and submitting the assessment no later than 5:00 PM on Tuesday, November 12.

**If you have a GitHub account:** Fork the repository, edit your responses, and respond to amy_hann@saa.senate.gov and Jobs_@appro.senate.gov with the URL to the GitHub repository containing your responses.
